Store the headlines in a Pandas DataFrame and add for each one the corresponding number, the length in characters, and the total number of words. Make sure you label appropriately the four columns in the DataFrame. Once you create the DataFrame print it as output and save it in a csv file.

Where I created a URL for blockchain for the date of April 8th 2022. Then, we had to test the connection by calling for the variable I created to get news articles from newsapi's to make sure my next cells would run. After which we formatted results using JSON. With sorted we were able to sort results according to articles, status and total results respectively. More specifically, isolating for articles with the blockchain keyword. A dataframe called df was then created in order to convert results into a dataframe. Lastly, we converted this dataframe to a csv. "
