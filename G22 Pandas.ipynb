    "Homework Project #2: Pandas DataFrame Manipulation Due Date: Wed. 3/30/22 (before class)\n",
    "\n",
    "Objective: To apply knowledge about Pandas Data Frames to analyze an existing dataset. Instructions: Complete this project in groups of two and without assistance from classmates or outside parties, or collusion with other groups. Doing so will be considered an academic integrity violation. See below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Requirements: Using the CSV file assigned to you (based on your group number), write Python code to read the file into a Pandas DataFrame analyze the data, and show the following output:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the appropriate Pandas method to list all the characteristics of your dataset, including number of rows and columns, column names, data types etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the appropriate count function to count and show the number of apps in each genre.\n",
    "\n",
    "Show all statistics (min, max, std, count and quartiles) of user ratings and size on the same summary table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Filter the dataset to list all paid apps with ratings under 1.5 and print the total number of apps that fulfill the condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write Python code to calculate which percentage of the apps in the dataset are free. Do not change Nan values to zero. Print the percentage on a 100 points basis, with no more than 2 decimals.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last cell of your notebook, write a paragraph explaining the results of manipulating this dataset with the above steps.\n",
    "Help: The following tutorial based on a different dataset might be helpful if you need some guidance: https://towardsdatascience.com/getting-started-to-data-analysis-with-python-pandas-with-titanic-dataset-a195ab043c77\n",
    "\n",
    "Submit for grading: Upload your Jupyter Notebook file (.ipynb) using the corresponding Blackboard Assignment link. Remove extra output. Only one submission per group is needed. Use the group number when you name your file (e.g., G7Pandas.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "Professor consultation while assignment is ongoing: To be fair to other students, the professor cannot “check your code to see if it is ok” before the deadline. Debugging your code is part of this assignment. However, your professor can help you figure out the meaning of an error message and/or answer questions about the code examples developed in class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Academic Integrity Warnings: Seeking outside assistance from other groups, advanced programmers or homework helping sites is considered an academic integrity violation and will be handled accordingly. If your program uses advanced data structures or libraries not covered in class, you will be asked to explain your code in an oral exam and/or in class. Please remember that copy/pasting code from the Web without attribution is considered an Academic Integrity violation and will be handled accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Honor Code: By submitting the required files, you attest that you completed this assignment with academic integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Grading Rubric: 40% independent verification of program run; 30% required and correct output; (eliminate the output of intermediate steps); 30% documentation (3 levels: 1= top of the notebook indicating title, names and date, 2= comments in code, and 3= labeling of the output), and interpretation of results in the last cell of the notebook."

Listing characteristics was possible with the .head() method. I was able to display the number of apps in each genre using the describe method. I was able to filter the datasets I was looking for by creating new dataframes out of the ones that already exist. I was able to get a summary table with the stats I needed using the describe method. I was able to find the percentatge of the apps in the dataset that are free by creating a new datafram where I isolated for the \"Free\" column where I then took the percentage for the whole dataframe. Overall, I learned a plethora about pandas dataframe manipulation through this assignment, and I am looking forward to compounding this knowledge."
